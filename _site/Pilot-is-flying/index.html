One fine day, towards the end of my final semester (May 2019) at IIST, my professor Dr. Priyadarshnam calls me up for a meeting with Dean R&amp;D. He asked to attend the meeting and propose a project idea. It was about 11 AM in the morning and the meeting was scheduled at around 1 PM in afternoon. I had just woken up and was barely in my senses. I started recollecting all the thoughts and ideas by now.

  <h1>B002 - PILOT is flying !</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p align="justify">
One fine day, towards the end of my final semester (May 2019) at <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/">IIST</a>, my professor <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/priyadarshnam">Dr. Priyadarshnam</a> calls me up for a meeting with Dean R&amp;D. He asked to attend the meeting and propose a project idea. It was about 11 AM in the morning and the meeting was scheduled at around 1 PM in afternoon. I had just woken up and was barely in my senses. I started recollecting all the thoughts and ideas by now. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Taking inspiration from <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/aris">ARIS</a> which had just flown aboard <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/mission_PSLV_C45.html">PSLV-C45 </a> ( which functioned pretty well in the spent fourth stage of PSLV ), I too started thinking in that direction. During my first semester, I was working at the Satellite lab (now <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/sspace">SSPACE</a>) for the development of an <a href="/projects/project_cdh/">On-board computer for small satellites</a>. At the same time,  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joji-john-varghese-62291883/">Joji</a> was also developing a TTC board. Both of these boards were almost ready and all they needed was power and a 1U supporting structure.  
</p>

<p align="justify">
Now that I had an OBC and a TTC, which was to fly aboard PSLV, I named it <b>P</b>SLV <b>I</b>n-orbita<b>L</b> testing of <b>O</b>BC and <b>T</b>TC or <b>PILOT</b>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I presented this idea on a two slide PPT during the meeting, and it was well appreciated. Today, after almost four years, after a few changes, the idea is materialised and PILOT is all set to fly aboard POEM-2 of <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/">ISRO</a>'s PSLV C-55.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
As <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/">ISRO</a> is preparing itself for the launch of it's workhorse rocket <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/PSLV_CON.html">PSLV</a> on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-pslv-c55-mission-isro-uses-new-rocket-integration-technique-to-cut-time/articleshow/99446716.cms?from=mdr">22nd April 2023</a>, I am eagerly waiting for PILOT to fly. I am sure this excitement is much more for the students and faculty members who have worked on the project.
