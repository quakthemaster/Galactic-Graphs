title: B001 - Launch of LVM3-M3 
---

&lt;p align="justify"&gt;
Watching a rocket launch was always on my bucket list. Fortunately, I could check it by witnessing the spectacular launch of ISRO's Bahubali (so called) rocket LVM3. The launch was scheduled on 26th March 2023 (Sunday) at 9:00 AM.  
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p align="justify"&gt;
LVM3 rocket launch on Sunday is a rare opportunity. Also, nothing can be a better treat for a weekend than experiencing the bright yellow burning tail of a rocket going up in the sky. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="justify"&gt;
Entering the launch gallery was totally different feeling altogether. People were carrying the Indian flags and were cheering for ISRO and India.
As the vehicle cleared the launch tower, everyone's eyes were just focued on the tip of the rocket as it smoothly cut through the clouds. I tried to capture the video with my camera. Here's the launch footage with my camera -
&lt;/p&gt;

## Few tips on watching the launch from ISRO's public gallery

1. Since, a lot of people visit on the launch day, it's a good idea to reach the location atleast one hour in advance to avoid traffic and clear security checking.
2. If its a day launch, carry an umbrella, binoculars and sun glasses. 
3. There are not much overnight stay options in Sullerpeta (nearest town to SHAR), better options could be Sricity, Chennai or Tirupati. 
4. The registration website for launch view gallery can be found [here](https://lvg.shar.gov.in/VSCREGISTRATION/index.jsp"). 
5. Make sure to check the launch pad from which rocket is going to take off and, find a place in the gallery so as to witness the launch right from liftoff. Here is how the second launch pad looks from the view gallery (you can identify launch with their lighting towers).
