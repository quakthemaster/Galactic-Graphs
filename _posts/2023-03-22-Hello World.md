title: B000 - Hello World !
---

Hello World! This is my first blog post. I have been thinking of starting the blog for a very long time but finally it officially starts on 22 Mar. 2023. Coincidentially this is also the start of a new year as the Hindu calender. 

I plan to write about Space, Data science and about my experiments with other technologies. 

Lot more to come! Stay tuned!
