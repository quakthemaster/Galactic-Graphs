I am an Engineer currently working at ISTRAC Bengaluru, India. I come from [Dhar](https://dhar.nic.in/en/), a small town near [Indore](https://indore.nic.in/en/) (M.P.). I have completed my Bachelor's degree from [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/). I love to talk about future of humans on Earth (or may be on Mars :P). In my free time, I try to go out and click pictures of Nature and Wildlife.
